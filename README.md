# AR-Software-Platform
Software Platform for Hardware-Agnostic Wearable AR Devices


Most AR devices are expensive, heavy, large, power-hungry hardware with low battery life and heating issues. The major reason for this is the large processing power and memory required to run AR applications on the edge. I proposed an alternative architecture that outsources most of the processing for AR applications to the cloud and mobile devices. Such an architecture could enable lightweight, memory and power efficient AR hardware in the future. I built out applications for translation, recipes/cooking, transcription, and chatGPT.

Currently runs on Android - clone & build via Gradle.
